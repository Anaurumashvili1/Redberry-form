          As we said, Redberry has been on the field for quite some time now,
          and we have touched and embraced a variety of programming languages,
          technologies, philosophies, and frameworks. We are battle-tested in
          PHP Laravel Stack with Vue.js, refined in React, and allies with
          Serverside technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and now we have
          set foot in the web3 industry.
